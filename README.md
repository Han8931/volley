# Volley

A Vim-centric TUI API client and load tester — a terminal alternative to
Postman, inspired by [posting](https://github.com/darrenburns/posting) but
built for Vim users and high-concurrency load testing.

**Status:** functional MVP — request/response, Vim URL/body editing, collections,
auth helpers, and curl import/export are in. Load testing is the next major
feature.

## Command line & variables

| Command            | Effect                                            |
|--------------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| `:new users/list`  | create/open a blank saved request                 |
| `:save users/list` | save the current request                          |
| `:save` / `:w`     | save back to the currently opened/created request |
| `:open users/list` | open a saved request                              |
| `:delete users/list` | delete a saved request                          |
| `:rename old new`  | rename a saved request                            |
| `:copy old new`    | copy a saved request                              |
| `:import curl …`   | fill the editor from a pasted curl command        |
| `:copy curl`       | copy the current request as a curl command        |
| `:mkgroup APISet1` | create a group (folder), even when empty          |
| `:rmgroup APISet1` | delete a group and everything under it            |
| `:rengroup old new`| rename a group                                    |
| `:ls`              | focus/refresh the collections tree                |
| `:method POST`     | set the HTTP method                               |
| `:set tok=abc123`  | define a variable usable as `{{tok}}`             |
| `:send`            | send the current request                          |
| `:timeout 10s`     | set the request timeout (or press `,t`)           |
| `:help`            | help overlay                                      |
| `:q` · `:q!`       | quit · quit discarding unsaved changes (`:qa` aliases work too) |
| `:wq` / `:x`       | save the current request, then quit (`:wqa`/`:xa` aliases work too) |

When a request has unsaved edits, switching to another request or quitting
prompts to **save** (`y`), **discard** (`n`), or **cancel** (`esc`) so your
changes are never silently lost. The method selector is its own focus target —
reach it with `tab`/`shift+tab` or the `ctrl+w` window motions. The timeout field
is edited inline with `,t` or `:timeout`. Arrow keys only move *within* the
focused pane, never between panes.

Saved requests are stored as JSON under Volley's user config directory:

- Linux: `~/.config/volley/collections/`
- macOS: `~/Library/Application Support/volley/collections/`
- Windows: `%AppData%\\volley\\collections\\`

Groups are folders: slash-separated names like `APISet1/auth/login` nest a
request inside groups. Empty groups persist (they keep a `.keep` marker), while
folders created implicitly by saving are cleaned up when their last request goes.

`{{name}}` placeholders in the URL, headers, params, auth fields, and body are
expanded at send time — resolved from `:set` variables first, then process
environment variables (so `{{HOME}}`, secrets exported in your shell, etc. work).
Unresolved placeholders are surfaced in the status bar before the request is
sent.

## Roadmap

- [x] **Phase 1** — UI skeleton, panes, Vim modal core
- [x] **Phase 2** — send request, render status + pretty-JSON response, Vim scroll
- [x] **Phase 3** — request editor: tabbed headers / body / params / auth, Vim KV editor
- [x] **Phase 4** — `:` command line, `/` response search, `y` yank, `?` help overlay
- [x] **Vim editing engine** (`internal/vimtext`) — motions, operators, counts, undo/redo, in the body editor
- [x] **Collections** — save/open/rename/copy/delete, NerdTree-style tree pane (native JSON storage)
- [x] **Auth helpers** — Bearer, Basic, and API-key auth, injected at send time
- [x] **curl import/export** — `:import curl …` and `:copy curl`
- [ ] Load testing (concurrency, RPS, p50/p95/p99, live charts)

> Note: collections are stored as native JSON under Volley's user config directory
> (`~/.config/volley/collections/` on Linux, `~/Library/Application Support/volley/collections/` on macOS).
> Posting-format import/export is not implemented yet; curl import/export is supported.
